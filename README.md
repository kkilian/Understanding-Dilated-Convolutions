# Understanding Dilated Convolutions

**Note:** This exploration is based on the paper "Multi-Scale Context Aggregation by Dilated Convolutions". You can find the paper [here](link_to_paper).

The Understanding Dilated Convolutions repository is an effort to comprehend the principles of Dilated Convolutions by implementing concepts from the paper "Multi-Scale Context Aggregation by Dilated Convolutions". Through practical code examples and explanations, I aim to gain insights into the benefits and applications of Dilated Convolutions.

## Overview

The core focus of this exploration includes:
- Exploring the theory and practical implementation of Dilated Convolutions.
- Providing clear code examples and explanations for better understanding.
- Demonstrating how Dilated Convolutions enhance multi-scale context aggregation.
